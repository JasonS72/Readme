<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Security Path</h2>

- <b>I started my path into security in June of 2023. I took some classes at the local community college, and later discovered WGU. Because I started in the summer with some transfer classes already finished, I could not take all the cyber program classes in the proper order. So I chose to finish at WGU because I could get a B.S. in about the same time as it would take to finish an A.A.S. at the community college. It took me 13 months to finish about 30 credits at the C.C., 40 credits at WGU, and another 30 or so through online platforms, and about 10 certs I needed as a part of school or to substitute for classes. Its been a busy last year. My B.S. is done! Currently I am about almost halfway finished with my M.S. at WGU, and about halfway to a Digital Forensics certificate at that same community college. I have a week by week path plotted for the next year that should allow me to finish both the M.S. and certificate, CCSP, CISSP (hopefully), CASP+, and laser-focused on hands on projects and labs that further the goals for the next yearYou can find more info in my blog about the specifics of my pathway choices, what worked, how to hack your way to a WGU degree as fast and cheap as possible, and what I would do different now.
