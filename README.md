<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Security Path</h2>

- <b>I started my path into security in June of 2023. I took some classes at the local community college, and later discovered WGU. Because I started in the summer with some transfer classes already finished, I could not take all the cyber program classes at the community college in the proper order. Because of that, it was actually cheaper and faster to finish a B.S. at WGU than it was to finish an A.A.S. at the community college. It took me 13 months to finish about 30 credits at the C.C., 40 credits at WGU, 30 or so through online platforms, and about 10 certs I needed as a part of school or to substitute for classes. It was a nice mix, and I am grateful for the time at the community college. Studying the basics in a more traditional format gave me a solid starting point prior to the transfer to WGU and their unique structure. Its been a busy last year. My B.S. is done! Currently I am about almost halfway finished with my M.S. at WGU. I have a week by week path plotted for the next year that should allow me to finish the M.S., CCSP, CISSP (hopefully), CASP+, and some hands on projects and labs that further those goals. I am in the process of documenting the specifics of the path I have taken, what worked, what didn't, and what I would do different now. Hopefully I can contribute some resources to others trying to pursue a similar path, and a place for a concise summary of what I have done for potential employers to look at.
- Prior to my journey into security I had worked in a management role within a hardware centric business with retail and K12 repair depot operations.</b>
