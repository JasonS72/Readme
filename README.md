<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Security Path</h2>

- <b>I started my path into security in June of 2023 with some classes at the local community college, later transferring to WGU. Because I started in the summer with some transfer classes already finished, I could not take all the cyber program classes at the community college in the proper order. I chose to transfer to WGU as it was actually cheaper and faster to finish a B.S. there than it was to finish an A.A.S. at the community college. It took me 13 months to finish about 30 credits at the C.C., 40 credits at WGU, 30 or so through online platforms, and about 10 certs I needed as a part of school. It was a very busy year! My experience at WGU has been great, but I am grateful I started at a local school. Studying the basics in a more traditional format gave me a solid starting point prior to the transfer to WGU and their unique structure. Currently I have finished my B.S.and am about halfway through the M.S. in Cybersecurity at WGU. Just like last year, I have a some lofty goals for this next year. For better or worse, WGU comes with a lot of certifications for free. I plan to take full advantage of that so ISC2 CCSP alongside Azure Security Engineer Associate are my current focus. CASP+ will come early next year, and assuming the CCSP goes well, I intend to continue on to finish the CISSP. Its a work in progress...
- Prior to my journey into security I worked 8 years in a management role at a hardware centric business with retail and K12 repair depot operations.
- Current focus- Building an Azure lab to "hybridize" with my home lab, in preparation for the Azure Security Engineer Associate Certification, with the mid-term goal of sitting the C.C.S.P. </b>
